Investigating Baseball Data
===========================

*Adam McCarthy*

Problem definition
------------------

Where do the best baseball players come from?

Will a baseball player´s birth location or college location relate to salary or awards?


Getting started
---------------

Run,

.. code-block:: bash

    $ Baseball_data_investigation.py

To download the dataset, 
and process it into one table tailored for this projects question.

Or see the notebooks to view and run
the `data examination <https://github.com/AdmcCarthy/Investigating_Baseball_Data/blob/master/resources/ipython%20notebook/Data%20Examination%20for%20Baseball%20Database.ipynb>`_ and preliminary `data analysis <https://github.com/AdmcCarthy/Investigating_Baseball_Data/blob/master/resources/ipython%20notebook/Data%20Analysis%20of%20Baseball%20Data.ipynb>`_.

Approach to answer question
---------------------------

Attributes will be needed to describe the location each player is from, these will form independent variables.

These will give a variety of values about where the player came from. However, it boils down to two
independent variables, college location and birth location. These variables have different scales
i.e. country, state, city. The right granularity will need to be chosen.

To use more independent variables height and weight can also be investigated.

Salaries, AwardsPlayers, AllStarFull and/or HallofFame can be used to give an indication to the quality of the player.
Any of these can be used as a dependent variable or a dependent variable could be created out of a combination
of these variables.

The dataset has been processed using numpy and pandas to clean, create new variables and
merge tables together. See further into the report for a section on data processing.
See the preprocessing module for the code used.

An examination of the data will be described followed by data analysis and conclusions.
The data analysis is not exhaustive so observations to do not lead to robust conclusions in
this report. Any inference is tentative and would require further work to become robust.


Data Examination
----------------

Overall the dataset is well organised and good to use.

Some datasets display issues regarding how the values are populated

.. figure:: resources\images\Weight_all_data.png
   :height: 200px
   :width: 200 px
   :scale: 50 %

   Fig._. Distribution of Weight in pounds for entire dataset

Weight highlights this well. The three figures above are of the same dataset,
by reducing the bin numbers to the number of unique values it can be seen that
common weight measurements are taken every 5 pounds. The lowermost figure
limits the x-axis to highlight this further. Some values are populated according to
a higher granularity. A solution to this issue would be to bin weight or similar issues.

Another common theme is highly skewed datasets.

.. figure:: resources\images\mean_salary_transform.png
   :height: 200px
   :width: 200 px
   :scale: 50 %

   Fig._. Distribution of mean career salary

The example of salary shows lognormal distributions with a large dispersion
of values towards the maximum value. The number of appearances in All Star matches, player awards and all forms of salary information display this style of data.

Some extreme outliers occur within the data

.. figure:: resources\images\Weight_2_all_data.png
   :height: 200px
   :width: 200 px
   :scale: 50 %

   Fig._. Distribution of Weight in pounds for entire dataset

Using weight again, but now with a rug plot to highlight where values occur.
The minimum weight value can be viewed (see annotation) as an isolated occurrence. The minimum weight is 65 pounds which are dramatically different than the rest of the sample.

This value can be found to be paired to a height of 43 inches and corresponds to
`Eddie Gaedel <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Gaedel>`_. This extreme outlier in both weight and height is a real occurrence!

The majority of baseball players are born in the USA.

   :height: 100px
   :width: 100 px
   :scale: 50 %

   Fig._. Binary plot showing ratio of players born in the USA using the total data set

.. figure:: resources\images\College_USA.png
   :height: 100px
   :width: 100 px
   :scale: 50 %

   Fig._. Binary plot showing ratio of player´s College being in the USA using investigation dataset

This combined with the entire amount of college location information being sourced in the USA steers this investigation to primarily focus on the USA.

It is beyond the scope of this investigation to do a complete
audit of all data in this database. Outliers will be assumed to be realistic,
nan values will not be interpolated. Queries will ignore missing values.

The reason for this is to look for trends in players that contain the corresponding data
rather than interpolating any salary or other information for this analysis.

Two key independent variables for this assessment are player´s birth state and college state. Both of these are categorical.

California is highlighted in both bar graphs below as the most common occurrence. There is a
variety across the other states, the two count bar graphs do not give any information about
how related a birth State and college State is.

   :height: 50px
   :width: 100 px
   :scale: 50 %

   Fig._. Bar graph showing the count of player´s mode College State location.

The birth city has 2208 unique values in the investigation data set while college cities have 721, giving too much granularity to be considered of use at this stage of the investigation. The state is a more usable aggregated category for analysis. 

Data Analysis
-------------

The following section is a brief, preliminary data analysis. This is not
a thorough exploratory data analysis or a more sophisticated data analysis
to test any hypotheses in the data.

The question is related to the effect of geographic location
on the quality of base ball players.

To begin a different independent variable can be compared to the
dependent variables to see if there are no relationships. Height
and weight would not be expected to have a strong correlation
to dependent variables.

Height vs. weight, two independent shows a strong correlation.

.. image:: resources\images\height_index.png
   :height: 100px
   :width: 100 px
   :scale: 50 %

When comparing one of these independent variables
to a dependent variable like the mean career salary
there is little correlation. The distribution reflects
the normal distribution of the weight variable.

.. image:: resources\images\weight_salary.png
   :height: 100px
   :width: 100 px
   :scale: 50 %

This is one example where there is not a strong relationship,
the Pearson correlation coefficient is only 0.18.

Before investigating the geography of a player the
dependent variables can be compared to each other.
There are a few options here from salary, Allstar counts and
award counts that can be compared to the independent variables.

The mean career salary and max ever career salary
are compared in the next plot. These show a strong
correlation. Note all these plots omit players
who do not have both of the variables recorded.

.. image:: resources\images\mean_max.png
   :height: 100px
   :width: 100 px
   :scale: 50 %

The mean annually standardized career salary compared
to the max standardized career, salary shows a similar
relationship with a slight curve upwards towards
max salary.

.. image:: resources\images\mean_max_std.png
   :height: 100px
   :width: 100 px
   :scale: 50 %

Comparing award count to Allstar
count there is a correlation that scores
0.7 on the Pearson correlation coefficient.

.. image:: resources\images\award_allstar.png
   :height: 100px
   :width: 100 px
   :scale: 50 %

The independent variables of a players birth
state and college state are used to describe
their geographic origins. The state is chosen
as city is too granular.

The two bar charts show the mean of all players means
career salary in a state. It also includes a 95%
confidence interval.

.. image:: resources\images\Bar_max_salary_birth.png
   :height: 50px
   :width: 100 px
   :scale: 50 %

.. image:: resources\images\Bar_max_salary_college.png
   :height: 50px
   :width: 100 px
   :scale: 50 %

The next two images use box plots to describe the
distribution of max salary standardized annually
by birth state and college state. The limitation
of this plot is that there are different
numbers within each state making the distribution
of values challenging to interpret.

.. image:: resources\images\box_birth.png
   :height: 50px
   :width: 100 px
   :scale: 50 %

.. image:: resources\images\box_college.png
   :height: 50px
   :width: 100 px
   :scale: 50 %

To compare both categorical variables of college and birth
state along with a third variable a heat map can be used.
This allows for relationships and trends between the two
independent variables to be studied. For example how many
of those born in a state remains in the same state for college.

The first heat map shows only players who have been present in
an Allstar match. The scale is fitted using quantiles so does not
show the full range of occurrences but rather gives a feel
for where there are more Allstar players. For each
pair of states, the number of Allstar matches players
have played in is summed.

The first thing that stands out is the diagonal
marking the times when a player goes to college
in the same state, they were born in.

.. image:: resources\images\heatmap_allstar.png
   :height: 200px
   :width: 200 px
   :scale: 50 %

California (CA), Arizona (AZ) and Texas (TX) all
show that they have colleges that have taken
all star players born in other states. In the case
of California because there is such a high count of players
from this state, there are also a number of all star players
being born in California and going on to study in different
states. Arizona is an interesting state in which it has
players attending college from other states but no Allstar
players born in Arizona leave for other colleges in other
states.

The final heat map shows a sum of all players annually
standardised max salary compared to birth state and 
college state. A divergent colour scale is used to
show if it is positive or negative, however, keep in mind
this is is the sum of all players in the pair of states
so states with very few players compared to pairs of states with
a much higher number of players will act differently.
An extremely high or low value may just be that there is only
one player from that state. This is a flaw in the plot
but at this stage in the investigation, the sum gives
an impression if there are any general trends regarding
baseball players from those states.

The figure highlights the same diagonal trend of players
attending college in the same state they were born in.

For college state California (CA), Florida (FL), 
NC (North Carolina)and Texas (TX)
each have players born in a wide range of states, each has players
born in almost every state.

.. image:: resources\images\heatmap_max_salary.png
   :height: 200px
   :width: 200 px
   :scale: 50 %

North Carolina as a college state has more negative values than most
other college states.

California has the most positive values compared to another college
states.

This could be continued by taking samples of players from
different states and designing a hypothesis test to investigate
if there is a statistically significant difference between
these groups.

Conclusions
-----------

This analysis is not thorough so any conclusions are tentative.
The project asked the question where do the best base ball players
come from.

The majority of base ball players come from within the USA.
California is where the most base ball players have been
born and where most have gone to college.

The majority of baseball players have attended college in
the same state they were born in.

There are differences between states in the typical quality
of baseball players, however, this also relates to the number
of players coming from or studying in each state.

Height and weight to not show strong relationships to the
quality of a player.

Quality of player could be defined as a combination of variables,
this analysis could use formal statistical tests to take
these ideas further.

Data processing
---------------

Approach to data processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Take the MASTER.csv table and use this as a central source for unique playerID, this will relate to many other tables.

Attributes will be needed to describe the location each player is from.

MASTER.csv also contains, birthCountry, birthState, birthCity which will be useful to investigate this question.

Schools and CollegePlaying are interesting candidates for positional information containing schoolCity, schoolState, schoolID are all values to explore.

CollegePlaying.csv gives the data, while Schools.csv gives the lookup to what the values in schoolID mean.

These will give a variety of values about where the player came from.

Salaries, AwardsPlayers, AllStarFull and/or HallofFame can be used to give an indication to the quality of the player.

Data processing workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Files are all csv files of high quality. playerID acts as a common key across different csv files.

Each file will be concatenated into the index of College Location, therefore reducing the data set only to areas where
College information is available.

   Fig.1. Distribution of Birth Year for entire dataset

The above figure shows the distribution of birth year for all data values with this attribute recorded.

The total number of values which have birth data are 18973.
The minimum is 1820. The mean is 1931

After selecting only data with information about which college was attended there are now only
6575 values and a difference in the distribution.

   :height: 200px
   :width: 200 px
   :scale: 50 %

   Fig.2. Distribution of Birth Year for data used here

The mean has moved up to 1947 with the data now more skewed towards more recent times.

This is a common theme within the data that different investigations will subset the dataset in different
ways. For example, salary data is only available after 1985.

Master
~~~~~~

MASTER.csv is a key dataset to look up playerID along with a number of key attributes needed for investigating where a player is from.


College location
----------------

CollegePlaying.csv and Schools.csv will need to be manipulated to give the location of the school. This will lead to city, state and country for each school.

One person can attend more than one school. For brevity, it is better to reduce this to one selection.

For simplicity, this is chosen alphabetically. So given a tie, tulane is selected over vandy.
This will create a bias in the selection criteria but is good enough for the moment.

Each player´s selected school's city, state and country will be appended to the player from Schools.csv

Some errors occur when trying to match schoolID from CollegePlaying.csv to Schools.csv. At least one occurrence
was found where it could not find a value from CollegePlaying.csv in Schools.csv. When this occurred the current
solution is to replace the value with 'NAN'.

Quality of player - Dependent variables
---------------------------------------

To see if there are any relationships between relatively better or worse players some form of an attribute will be needed to qualify quality.

These will form a variety of variables that could be dependent on other variables.

Salaries
~~~~~~~~

Salaries are one option, this data is delivered on a yearly basis. This would need to be manipulated into a single value, e.g. mean yearly salary. However, this will not compare well over time so would need to be compared to other salaries in that year.

Salary data has only been collected since 1985. Given that salary changes over time due to a combination of factors, it is difficult to
compare one year to another year.

Processing includes standardizing salary annually to see which players
earn more than others for each year.

To be able to make some simple comparisons each player´s career salary information needs to be compressed into single values.
Min, max and mean have been chosen, for annually standardized and unstandardized.

AwardsPlayers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

AwardsPlayers gives a value that could be manipulated into a number of awards per player.

Processed to find the number of times a player has received an award.

Awards go back to 1877, however, the occurrence of awards varies over time as the number of awards
given out per year changes.

AllStarFull
~~~~~~~~~~~

AllStarFull could also give a number of times present in the All Star game classifier.

Processed to find the number of times a player has played in an all star game.

Data only begins at 1933. The highest number of occurrences in all star games is 25 by aaronha01.

HallofFame
~~~~~~~~~~

HallofFame can also give a qualifier to compare to.

Processed to find all inducted members within the hall of fame.

Data only begins at 1933. There are 250 players in the hall of fame. 

Other
~~~~~

There are a number of limitations to these approaches related to how each of these has changed through time.

Performance statistics like Batting or Fielding could be used but will be left out for this analysis.
